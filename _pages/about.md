Hey! ðŸ‘‹

I am Aleksandr Razin, an MSc graduate in Machine Learning from ITMO University, currently seeking a PhD focused on generative methods for visual synthesis and understanding, controllable AI, and deep metric and representation learning.

Broadly, I am interested in generative AI, computer vision, and making AI systems more controllable and efficient. I enjoy bridging the gap between theoretical advances and real-world applications.

During my research journey, I've worked on pipeline inspection robotics (patented), improved industrial computer vision at Huawei, and developed depth-conditioned diffusion models for super-resolution. My thesis focused on enhancing generative models with spatial conditioning to reduce artifacts and improve quality.

Lately, I have been focusing on: (1) Few-shot personalization in generative models, (2) Quality-efficiency trade-offs in diffusion models, and (3) Self-improving data ecosystems for robust AI systems.

You can find my [CV](/cv/) here. I am always open to collaboration â€” feel free to reach out via email!
