Hey! 👋

I’m Aleksandr Razin, an MSc graduate in Machine Learning from ITMO University. My research sits at the intersection of image restoration, generative computer vision, and multimodal learning. I’m broadly interested in controllable, personalized generative systems that combine structural understanding with creative synthesis under low latency, and I enjoy turning theoretical advances into practical, reliable tools.

Along the way, I’ve worked on pipeline-inspection robotics (patented) and advanced industrial computer vision at Huawei, where I focused on efficient image restoration—super-resolution, denoising, and demosaicing for both images and video—as well as diffusion models for image generation. My MSc thesis studied spatial conditioning in generative models, with a depth-conditioned approach to super-resolution that reduced artifacts and improved fidelity in low-level vision tasks.

Currently, I’m turning image restoration methods into generative modeling to improve personalization and efficiency. I’m seeking a PhD supervisor/professor and open to challenging, impactful research opportunities.

You can find my [CV](/cv/) here. I’m always open to collaboration, feel free to reach out by email!
